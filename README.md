## Description
A web based sorting algorithm visualizer built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
It visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work through animated comparisons and swaps.

## Features
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Adjustable array size
- Adjustable animation speed
- Pause and resume sorting
- Visual highlighting of operations

## How It Works
- Generates an array and renders it as vertical bars
- Sorting algorithms record operations as animation steps
- Animation steps are played sequentially to visualize sorting
- Sorting logic is separated from rendering logic

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open index.html in your favourite web browser.
No extra requirements!

## PS
Thank you for checking out my project.
This was paticularly not easy to do, but few hours on the whiteboard and the results started showing.
